 # about me:
At this stage, I want to get into programming, because I realized that this interests me much more than other professions.I studied at the Mathematics and Information Lyceum, so I am more inclined towards the exact sciences and I think that I chose the right path by applying to you for a course.I am ready to find something new for myself and explore it, as I am diligent and purposeful.
